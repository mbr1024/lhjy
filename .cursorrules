# Project Rules & AI Behavior Guidelines

# Language Settings

You must strictly adhere to the following language rules:
1. **Thinking Process:** You should attempt to think in Chinese. If thinking in English helps your logic, you may do so, but the final output must be in Chinese.
2. **Response:** Your final answer, code comments, and explanations must ALWAYS be in Simplified Chinese (简体中文).
3. **Code:** Variable names and standard syntax remain in English, but comments should be in Chinese.

# General
- Follow the user's coding style and preferences where applicable.
- Always prioritize the user's latest request.
- **Validation**: Before generating any output, ask yourself: "Is my final output in Chinese?"
